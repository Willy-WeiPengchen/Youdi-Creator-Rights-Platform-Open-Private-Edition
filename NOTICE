Creator Rights Bank – Private Edition (CRB-PE)

Conceptual Framework Initiated by Wei Pengchen · December 31, 2025
﻿
This repository publishes a governance and technical reference framework for creator attribution and rights evidence management in the AI era.
﻿
It is strictly a documentation project — containing no software, no API, no executable code, and no mechanism for enforcing creator consent, licensing, or revenue distribution.
﻿
Clarifications:
﻿
1. No Creator Rights Are Managed Here
This framework does not collect, store, or represent any actual creator’s intellectual property.
It proposes a method for how platforms might build a rights evidence database — but all decisions about inclusion, consent, licensing terms, and royalty allocation must be made directly between creators and each platform via separate legal agreements.
﻿
2. No Authorization or Agency
The Creator Rights Bank is not an agent, trustee, or representative of any creator.
It does not grant, negotiate, or enforce any usage rights.
﻿
3. Mandatory Attribution for Theoretical References
Any entity that adopts, references, or implements any theoretical concept from this framework must visibly credit:
﻿
Wei Pengchen (韦朋辰) – China
as the originator of such theoretical constructs.
﻿
4. Attribution Standard as Framework Feature
This framework recommends that any rights evidence database implemented based on its principles incorporate a systematic attribution mechanism for all included works, ensuring creator identity and contextual integrity are preserved.

5. Exemplary Implementation
To illustrate the level of attribution clarity and cultural fidelity achievable, the following format is provided as a reference implementation for Wei Pengchen’s works:

text
Creator: Wei Pengchen (韦朋辰) – China  
Theoretical Systems:  
- YuXuan-ZhouYu-DaoSheng Theory (语玄宙宇道生论)  
- YuXuan Theory (语玄论)  
- (Seven) Xuan Generation ((七)玄生成)  
- Wei Pengchen Generative School (韦朋辰生成派)
This example demonstrates how full name, native language representation, regional/cultural identifiers, and theoretical context can be systematically preserved — serving as a benchmark for what a well-designed attribution system should aspire to achieve.  
﻿
6. Purpose of This Repository
To provide a public, timestamped reference for Wei Pengchen's proposed approach to Creator attribution and rights evidence management in the AI Era.
Implementation, compliance, and legal validity rest entirely with adopting parties.
﻿
This NOTICE serves as an ethical and intellectual provenance requirement, not a license, contract, or rights assignment.
